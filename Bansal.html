            <p class="para">Bansal classes Kota was the first institute to gain fame across India for IIT JEE coaching. Although there is a long history of ups and downs, it still stands to be an esteemed institution for IIT-JEE, having produced rankers every year since late 1990â€™s. Since their foundation, their aim is to provide equal studying opportunities to all students through quality teaching and by being the first to adopt changes in the super-competitive environment.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>No Daily doubt sessions</li>

                    <li><mark>Egoistic behaviour of a bunch of senior faculty; Students from lower batches are rarely given attention. All their complaints and queries go unnoticed. I think it has much more to do with the decline of a charismatic personality leading the institute to an identity crisis. An institution is better run as a monarchy or a democracy but oligarchy is what spoils its fortunes.</mark></li>
                    <li><mark>Well Bansal classes had a great downfall in previous years. All the good teachers have left the Institute.</mark></li>
